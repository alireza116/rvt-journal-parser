# rvt-journal-parser
code to parse revit journal files

## journalParser.ipynb
contains a parser function that returns a dataframe and a list of dictionaries.

## datavis folder
includes the d3 project that gets the result of the parser and visualizes. Note that it's better to only filter the commands and warnings for the interface.
